# How to use service mesh

To consider it, it is necessary to understand independent dimensions of configuration for an Istio deployment as below:

- single or multiple cluster  --> But what I'm interested in is a behavior of multi-cluster case only.
- single or multiple network
- single or multiple control plane
- single or multiple mesh

# 1. Without Istio service mesh

- If EndPoint-A has a logic accessing to Container-B in the same cluster, the access goes through svc-B because it needs to have the stable IP not by a ephemeral IP.
- If EndPoint-A has a logic accessing to Container-B in the diffrent cluster, it is not reachable because ClusterIP is not shared each other even though clusters are located in same network.
- Kube-proxy creates an iptables rule for each of the backend Pods in the Service.
- After catching the traffic sent to the ClusterIP, iptables forwards that traffic directly to one of the backend Pod using DNAT. 

The following is a case of

- multiple cluster
- single network
- no control plane
- no mesh
```
Cluster1                                                Cluster2

# 2. With a single Istio service mesh in the same network

- If EndPoint-A has a logic accessing to Service-B, the access is hi-jacked by Envoy proxy in the pod. The access travels along on service mesh. 
- There is an endpoint of Service-B in each cluster (both Cluster1 and Cluster2). So, the access from EndPoint-A will go to either EndPoint-B in Cluster1 or in Cluster2.
- An Istio control plane manages traffic within the mesh by providing each proxy with the list of service endpoints.
- Each cluster must have a DNS entry for the service in order for the DNS lookup to succeed, and a request to be successfully sent. This is true even if there are no instances of that serviceâ€™s pods running in the cluster which makes requests.
- For clusters spanning networks, this can be achieved by exposing the control plane through an Istio gateway which goes thru such as internal load balancers. (But I don't draw the Istio gateway in the figure below, because of no space to draw it and it also gets so complicating to understand.)
- Istio Citadel is for CA (Certificate Authority). See also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmZz8KpSY74.

# 4. With multiple Istio service mesh in different network
- In order to ensure secure communications in a multi-network scenario, Istio only supports cross-network communication to workloads with an Istio proxy. This is due to the fact that Istio exposes services at the Ingress Gateway with TLS pass-through, which enables mTLS directly to the workload.
- IngressGateway consumes "VirtualService", while IngressController consumes "Ingress" as a resouce.
- You may use Intel QAT for acceleration of TLS process in Istio proxy using Intel QAT device plugin. (https://01.org/kubernetes/solutions/QAT-envoy-solution)

- multiple cluster
- multiple network
- multiple control plane

# 5. Joining virtual machines into the mesh 
Istio provides two mechanisms to represent virtual machine workloads:
- WorkloadGroup represents a logical group of virtual machine workloads that share common properties. This is similar to a Deployment in Kubernetes.
- WorkloadEntry represents a single instance of a virtual machine workload. This is similar to a Pod in Kubernetes.
- In order for consumers to reliably call your workload, itâ€™s recommended to declare a Service association. (But I don't draw it in the figure below.)

With this configuration, requests to product would be load-balanced across both the pod and virtual machine workload instances.

See also https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/vm-architecture/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B8maYcjq_c.

The following is a case of 
- multiple cluster       (2 Clusters)
- multiple network       (3 Networks)
- multiple control plane (2 Controle Planes)
- multiple mesh          (2 Meshes, But 3 Meshes if VirtualMachine has an independent CA rather than Cluster1 and2.)
```

# 5-1. How to join virtual machines into the mesh
https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/virtual-machine/

# 5-1-1. Master node in kubernetes cluster

(1) Set some environment valuse.
```
VM_APP="nginx"
VM_NAMESPACE="vmcluster"
WORK_DIR="${HOME}/vmintegration"
SERVICE_ACCOUNT="nginxonmyvm"
CLUSTER_NETWORK=""
VM_NETWORK=""
CLUSTER="Kubernetes"
```
(2) Make a work directory.
```
# mkdir -p $WORK_DIR
# kubectl create namespace "${VM_NAMESPACE}"
# kubectl create serviceaccount "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" -n "${VM_NAMESPACE}"
```
(3) Check if third party tokens are enabled in your cluster.
- See also https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#configure-third-party-service-account-tokens
```
# kubectl get --raw /api/v1 | jq '.resources[] | select(.name | index("serviceaccounts/token"))'
{
  "name": "serviceaccounts/token",
  "singularName": "",
  "namespaced": true,
  "group": "authentication.k8s.io",
  "version": "v1",
  "kind": "TokenRequest",
  "verbs": [
    "create"
  ]
}
```
(4) Make a Yaml file for workloadgroup.
```
# cat <<EOF > workloadgroup.yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: WorkloadGroup
metadata:
  name: "${VM_APP}"
  namespace: "${VM_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: "${VM_APP}"
  template:
    serviceAccount: "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}"
    network: "${VM_NETWORK}"
EOF
```
(5) Generate the istio-token and Copy it to the VM which you want to join into the cluster.
```
# istioctl x workload entry configure -f workloadgroup.yaml -o "${WORK_DIR}" --clusterID "${CLUSTER}"
Warning: a security token for namespace "vmcluster" and service account "nginxonmyvm" has been generated and stored at "/root/vmintegration/istio-token"
2022-01-10T05:37:08.373544Z	warn	Could not auto-detect IP for. Use --ingressIP to manually specify the Gateway address to reach istiod from the VM.%!(EXTRA string=istiod.istio-system.svc, string=istio-system)
Configuration generation into directory /root/vmintegration was successful
```
```
# cd $HOME
# tar cvfz vmintegration.tar.gz vmintegration/
# scp -p vmintegration.tar.gz vagrant@<ipaddress of vm>:/home/vagrant/
```
