# How to use service mesh

To consider it, it is necessary to understand independent dimensions of configuration for an Istio deployment as below:

- single or multiple cluster  --> But what I'm interested in is a behavior of multi-cluster case only.
- single or multiple network
- single or multiple control plane
- single or multiple mesh

# 1. Without Istio service mesh

- If EndPoint-A has a logic accessing to Container-B in the same cluster, the access goes through svc-B because it needs to have the stable IP not by a ephemeral IP.
- If EndPoint-A has a logic accessing to Container-B in the diffrent cluster, it is not reachable because ClusterIP is not shared each other even though clusters are located in same network.
- Kube-proxy creates an iptables rule for each of the backend Pods in the Service.
- After catching the traffic sent to the ClusterIP, iptables forwards that traffic directly to one of the backend Pod using DNAT. 

The following is a case of

- multiple cluster
- single network
- no control plane
- no mesh
```
Cluster1                                                Cluster2

# 2. With a single Istio service mesh in the same network

- If EndPoint-A has a logic accessing to Service-B, the access is hi-jacked by Envoy proxy in the pod. The access travels along on service mesh. 
- There is an endpoint of Service-B in each cluster (both Cluster1 and Cluster2). So, the access from EndPoint-A will go to either EndPoint-B in Cluster1 or in Cluster2.
- Each cluster must have a DNS entry for the service in order for the DNS lookup to succeed, and a request to be successfully sent. This is true even if there are no instances of that serviceâ€™s pods running in the cluster which makes requests.

The following is a case of 
- multiple cluster
- single network
- single control plane
- single mesh

# 4. With multiple Istio service mesh in different network
- In order to ensure secure communications in a multi-network scenario, Istio only supports cross-network communication to workloads with an Istio proxy. This is due to the fact that Istio exposes services at the Ingress Gateway with TLS pass-through, which enables mTLS directly to the workload.
- IngressGateway consumes "virtualservice", while IngressController consumes "Ingress" as a resouce.
- You may use Intel QAT for acceleration of TLS process in Istio proxy using Intel QAT device plugin. (https://01.org/kubernetes/solutions/QAT-envoy-solution)

- multiple cluster
- multiple network
- multiple control plane
